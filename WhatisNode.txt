Node js frees Javascript from the confides of the browser. 
It is built on Google's open source V8 Javascript engine and brings 
event-driven programming to web servers. Since Node enables 
development of fast web servers capable of asynchronous input/output
 to be written in JavaScript, it has become very popular with web 
 developers in relatively short period of time.
